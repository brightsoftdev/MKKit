/**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Overview*
 
 The MKIAPController executes inApp Purchases for you. This class is used by the MKIAPViewController. It can be
 used by itself as well, if you want to create your own store front.
 
 MKIAPController works in two ways. You can create an instance of it, preform requests and then recive the responses
 through the delegate. Your other option is to use factory methods with code blocks to handle the response. 
 
 @warning *Note* If you are using the MKAIPViewController, inApp Purchases are built in. The only thing not done by 
 the MKAIPViewController is restoring purchases.
 
 *Custom Store Front Usage*
 
 If you use your own store front instead of the MKIAPViewController, MKIAPContoller can still be used to process
 your transactions. Transactions can be montitored using code blocks or the MKIAPContollerDelegate. 
 
 When using code blocks you need to open and close the store. Use the openStore and closeStore class methods to do this.
 Opening and closeing only needs to be done once. After the openStore method is called, you can process as many transactions
 as you need. It is important to close the store once all transactions are complete. The closeStore class method
 closes out the store kit delegates and observers as well as releases the MKIAPController.
 
 Review the source code of MKIAPViewController and MKTableCellIAP to see examples on using code blocks for your
 inApp purchases.
 
 To use the MKIAPControllerDelegate to monitor transactions, you need to create an instance of MKIAPController.
 Ensure that your store front conforms to the MKIAPDelegate protocols.
 
 *Using the Singleton*
 
 MKIAPController offers a singleton instance if need. You can get the singleton by calling the sharedStore class method.
 The singleton instance can work with both code blocks or the MKIAPControllerDelegate. 
 
 @warning *Note* The openStore and closeStore class methods opperate off the singleton instance. The closeStore method
 will remove the singleton instance from memory.
